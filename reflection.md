4.5 Project Reflection
1️ Commit Evidence
A screenshot of the GitHub commit history (showing both members’ contributions) is included below.
 

2️ Actual Task Split
Task / Deliverable	Sahithi Reddy Gudi (12275248)	Sreelakshmi Gundla (12312955)
4.1.1 Assumptions & Network Overview	 Lead	 Reviewed and edited
4.1.2 Network Design & Diagrams (HQ + Branch WAN)	 Lead – draw.io diagrams	 Reviewed and formatted
4.1.3 IP Addressing Plan	 Created IPv4 schema	 Verified subnets
4.2 Cloud Analysis (Azure vs AWS)	 Reviewed	 Lead – pricing calculations
4.3 Risk Assessment & Controls	 Assisted	 Lead – TVA Matrix Excel
4.4 Ethical & Social Issues	 Lead – drafted regulations	 Edited final references
4.5 Reflection	 Co-authored	 Co-authored
GitHub Repository Setup / Pushes	 Initial repo creation	 Regular updates and uploads
 This task division ensured both members contributed equally across technical and written components.

3️ Commit Analysis
Student	Approx. Commits	Major Tasks Contributed To	Comment
Sahithi Reddy Gudi	~22 commits	Network design, IP plan, ethics report	Frequent early commits (setup, diagrams, markdown).
Sreelakshmi Gundla	~18 commits	Cloud pricing, risk assessment, final edits	Larger, less-frequent commits (spreadsheet + docs).
Analysis:
Although Sahithi recorded slightly more commits, both made comparable contributions.
Sahithi committed smaller incremental changes (each diagram or section update separately).
Sreelakshmi preferred batching several edits (e.g., cloud files + Excel upload) into single commits.
Hence, commit count ≠ effort — it reflects individual working styles.
In GitHub-based group work, qualitative assessment (task complexity, document leadership) is more accurate than raw commit totals.

4️ Team Activity Timeline
•	Weeks 2 – 3: Repo created & basic layout set up.
•	Weeks 4 – 6: Active network design and diagram commits by Sahithi.
•	Weeks 7 – 8: Cloud analysis and risk assessment files added by Sreelakshmi.
•	Weeks 9 – 10: Ethics and Reflection sections finalised jointly.

Both members made commits in at least 6 different weeks, including early and final stages — sufficient for continuous collaboration.
There were no long gaps; communication remained steady through chat and class sessions.

5️ Teamwork Reflection & Future Techniques
What Worked Well
•	Clear task division: Each member led areas aligned with their strengths (technical vs research).
•	Incremental committing: Frequent pushes helped track progress and avoid file conflicts.
•	Peer review: Each draft was reviewed by the other before merging to main branch.
Challenges Encountered
•	Occasional merge conflicts due to parallel edits.
•	Slight imbalance in early vs late-stage workloads (more technical work in mid-term).
Recommended Techniques for Future Projects
Technique	Description	Problem Solved
Branching Strategy	Use feature/ branches for each task and pull requests for reviews.	Prevents merge conflicts and ensures code review before merging.
Weekly Stand-ups	10-minute check-ins each week to track progress and blockers.	Improves accountability and early detection of delays.
Issue Tracking	Create GitHub Issues for each task with assignees and deadlines.	Clarifies responsibilities and visualises task completion.
Commit Naming Convention	Prefix messages (e.g., feat:, fix:, doc:).	Improves repo readability and changelog accuracy.
Peer Review Checklist	Validate grammar, accuracy, references before merge.	Enhances document quality and mutual learning.
These techniques encourage structured collaboration, enhance transparency, and maintain version control integrity — aligning with DevSecOps teamwork principles.

 Summary
This project strengthened our technical understanding of network design, cloud analysis, and cyber risk management, while improving teamwork and version-control proficiency.
Despite minor coordination challenges, the group maintained strong communication, met all milestones, and delivered a balanced, high-quality submission.
