4.4 Ethical and Social Issues
Overview
As Truelec expands its digital presence through online systems (CRM, HR, project tracking, and client portals), it must address ethical and legal challenges related to how personal and business data is collected, processed, and stored.
Like a travel agency managing client bookings and payments, Truelec’s CRM and HR systems hold sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) — including contact details, financial data, and project documentation.
A breach or misuse of such data could significantly impact clients, staff, and company reputation, making privacy and data governance central to ethical operations.

1. Types of Data Collected
Truelec’s systems capture multiple categories of information:
Data Category	Description	Source
Customer Data	Names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, payment history	CRM System
Employee Data	Payroll records, tax details, medical leave, ID numbers	HR & Payroll System
Project Records	Quotations, designs, invoices, contracts	ERP / File Server
IoT & Security Data	CCTV footage, RFID access logs, device telemetry	IoT Systems
Website Analytics	Cookies, session IDs, location data	Company Website
Ethically, Truelec has a duty to ensure informed consent is obtained before collecting or using such data and to maintain transparency about how it is stored, shared, and retained.
2. Key Privacy and Security Risks
1.	Unauthorised Access or Data Breach:
Weak authentication or misconfigured permissions could expose CRM or HR data. Stolen credentials might allow attackers to download entire client lists.
2.	Phishing & Social Engineering:
Employees may reveal sensitive data or credentials if deceived by fake invoices or booking requests.
3.	Insider Misuse:
Staff with excessive system privileges may export data for personal gain, violating both legal and ethical principles of confidentiality.
4.	Cloud Data Sovereignty Risks:
Hosting CRM/HR in overseas cloud data centres may breach local data sovereignty laws if data leaves Australian jurisdiction.
5.	IoT Device Exploitation:
Insecure CCTV or RFID devices could be hijacked, leading to unauthorised surveillance or physical security compromise.
These risks underline the ethical principle of non-maleficence — organisations must act to avoid foreseeable harm to clients or employees through negligence or poor system design.
3. Relevant Legal and Regulatory Frameworks
Truelec, operating in Australia, must comply with several key privacy frameworks:
Regulation	Scope	Relevance
Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)	Federal law governing personal data handling	Requires consent for collection, secure storage, and access rights
Australian Privacy Principles (APPs 1–13)	Detailed obligations for transparency, use, disclosure, and data quality	APP 11 mandates protection from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access
Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme 2018	Requires OAIC notification and client disclosure after serious data breach	Promotes accountability and timely response
GDPR (EU, if serving EU clients)	Regulates cross-border data transfers	Applies if Truelec handles EU residents’ data via cloud CRM
Non-compliance may lead to legal penalties, OAIC investigations, or civil claims from affected parties.
According to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), 68% of all reported breaches in 2024 originated from human error or compromised credentials — reinforcing the need for multi-layered security (OAIC, 2024).
4. Social & Ethical Impacts of a Breach
Stakeholder	Potential Impact	Severity
Customers / Clients	Identity theft, spam, loss of trust in company	High
Employees	Exposure of personal payroll or medical data	High
Company	Legal penalties, brand damage, customer loss	Very High
Suppliers / Partners	Disrupted operations, loss of shared credentials	Medium
If Truelec’s CRM database (client information) were leaked, hundreds of individuals could face identity fraud, phishing, or unauthorised use of contact details. Ethically, this undermines trust, which is foundational for service industries.

5. Ethical Best Practices & Mitigation
To address these concerns, Truelec should:
•	Implement data minimisation — collect only what is necessary.
•	Ensure encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
•	Introduce MFA for all logins (especially CRM/HR).
•	Apply role-based access control (RBAC) and review permissions quarterly.
•	Maintain employee training on phishing and privacy awareness.
•	Draft clear data retention and deletion policies.
•	Conduct annual privacy audits and DPIAs (Data Protection Impact Assessments) for new systems.
By aligning with Privacy-by-Design and Accountability principles, Truelec can uphold ethical standards and protect stakeholder interests.
